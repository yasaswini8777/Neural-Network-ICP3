1. Create a class Employee and then do the following 
   Create a data member to count the number of Employees 
   Create a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department 
   Create a function to average salary 
   Create a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee class
   Create the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their member functions.

2. Using NumPy create random vector of size 20 having only float in the range 1-20. Then reshape the array to 4 by 5 Then replace the max in each row by 0 (axis=1) (you can NOT implement it via for loop)
